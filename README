About

This module packages several additional hashing digests in a
hashlib-compatible format. It implements the following digests:

-   null - Always outputs null byte “hashes”, with a configurable
    digest_size
-   random - Always outputs random “hashes”, with a configurable
    digest_size
-   crc32 - CRC32 digest, 4 byte digest_size
-   adler32 - Adler-32 digest, 4 byte digest_size
-   fletcher16 - Fletcher 8-bit implementation, 2 byte digest_size
-   fletcher32 - Fletcher 16-bit implementation, 4 byte digest_size
-   fletcher64 - Fletcher 32-bit implementation, 8 byte digest_size
-   cksum - Unix cksum checksum, 4 byte digest_size
-   sysv - Unix System V checksum, 2 byte digest_size
-   bsd - BSD checksum, 2 byte digest_size
-   udp - UDP checksum, 2 byte digest_size
-   twoping - 2ping checksum, 2 byte digest_size

Unless stated, all digest outputs are big-endian (network byte order).

“sysv”, “bsd” and “cksum” results are just the hash (in byte form), even
though technically the full checksum (as returned by “sum” and “cksum”)
is comprised of the decimal hash and input length, separated by a space.


Example

    >>> import hashlib_additional
    >>> digest = hashlib_additional.new('crc32')
    >>> digest.update(b'foo')
    >>> digest.hexdigest()
    '8c736521'

    >>> hashlib_additional.algorithms_available
    {'adler32', 'bsd', 'cksum', 'crc32', 'fletcher16', 'fletcher32',
     'fletcher64', 'null', 'random', 'sysv', 'twoping', 'udp'}

    >>> digest = hashlib_additional.twoping(b'bar')
    >>> digest.digest()
    b'+\x9e'
