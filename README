HASHLIB_ADDITIONAL - ADDITIONAL HASHLIB-COMPATIBLE HASHING DIGESTS


https://github.com/rfinnie/python-hashlib_additional


About

This module packages several additional hashing digests in a
hashlib-compatible format. It implements the following digests:

-   null - Always outputs null byte "hashes", with a configurable
    digest_size
-   random - Always outputs random "hashes", with a configurable
    digest_size
-   crc32 - CRC32 digest, 4 byte digest_size
-   adler32 - Adler-32 digest, 4 byte digest_size
-   bsd - BSD checksum, 2 byte digest_size
-   udp - UDP checksum, 2 byte digest_size
-   twoping - 2ping checksum, 2 byte digest_size

Unless stated, all digest outputs are big-endian (network byte order).


Example

    >>> import hashlib_additional
    >>> digest = hashlib_additional.new('crc32')
    >>> digest.update(b'foo')
    >>> digest.hexdigest()
    '8c736521'

    >>> hashlib_additional.algorithms_available
    {'twoping', 'random', 'bsd', 'null', 'udp', 'crc32', 'adler32'}

    >>> digest = hashlib_additional.twoping(b'bar')
    >>> digest.digest()
    b'+\x9e'
